# Spatial-Graph-Adapter-Pattern
This research provides a data pattern that allows spatial relationships to be captured at a more granular and descriptive level than has been possible thus far. This pattern is hosted by a modular and extensible framework used for translating between different data formats without needing to change current schemas or work flows. The Spatial Graph Adapter Pattern is used as a modular adapter for Building Industry information leading to interoperability with OGC standards; additionally, the pattern and extensible proof of concept Linked Data Platform is demonstrated with a case study example for BIM data.
